Welcome to the CouchApp Tutorial!
=================================

You will learn how to build a simple note taking application which is stored in a CouchDB. The complete logic, design and data of the application will be contained within a single database. This gives the benefit of CouchDBs replication feature and other database specific properties to your application for free.
The application will run in any recent webbrowser that is able to interpret JavaScript - this means that it will work with mobile devices as well as with desktop computers.

Basic knowledge of CouchDB, JavaScript and HTML is assumed. We will combine these and other techniques to produce a simple example.

In this tutorial, system specific commands are based on *Linux* / *Bash*.

Please be advised that you should follow this tutorial step by step if you want to have your CouchApp working right. There are a lot of cross references inside the code and it is easy to lose track. However, if you are confident enough to do otherwise, please feel free to do so. ;-)
